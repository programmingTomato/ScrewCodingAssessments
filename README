This program is a Python app that captures your Chrome coding challenge, sends it to OpenAI, and displays the solution â€” without being seen in the taskbar or screen shares.

-=Features=-
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o to solve and return code
- Hidden window (not in taskbar, Alt+Tab, or screen recorders)
- Optional click-through mode

-=Installation=-

1. Install python if not already installed

2. Clone the repo:

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Edit and add the `.env` file. You will need an OpenAI key and a language that you want the question solved in (default is python)

5. Run the program by using python ScrewCodingAssessments.py

-=How to Use=-
While the program is running, navigate to any Hackerrank, leetcode or other code assessment challenge and press Win + F12. After a few moments (could be longer depending on the scope of the problem) a small box should appear with the answer code in it. Simply type the answer code into the assessment box.
